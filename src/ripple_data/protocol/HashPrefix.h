/** Prefix for hashing functions.

    These prefixes are inserted before the source material used to
    generate various hashes. This is done to put each hash in its own
    "space." This way, two different types of objects with the
    same binary data will produce different hashes.

    Each prefix is a 4-byte value with the last byte set to zero
    and the first three bytes formed from the ASCII equivalent of
    some arbitrary string. For example "TXN".

    @note Hash prefixes are part of the Ripple protocol.
